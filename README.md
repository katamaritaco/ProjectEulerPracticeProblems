# ProjectEulerPracticeProblems
My code for working out Project Euler problems

I'm currently using it as a platform to mess around with golang more. I may eventually port solutions to other languages in attempt to learn those languages or use more interesting solutions.

TODO: 

Format this readme so this is nice to read, clickable links to problems, and says not only which ones I have completed, but also which ones I have posted on the forums about.

Benchmark the solutions to know how fast or slow they are...
