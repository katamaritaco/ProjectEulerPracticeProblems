# ProjectEulerPracticeProblems
My code for working out Project Euler problems

I'm currently using it as a platform to mess around with golang more. I may eventually port solutions to other languages in attempt to learn those languages or use more interesting solutions.

My current format for solving problems is randomly pick a problem, think about how to solve it, and start with hello.go template.



Some TODOs for me: 

* Format this readme so this is nice to read, clickable links to problems, and says not only which ones I have completed, but also which ones I have posted on the forums about.

* Benchmark the solutions to know how fast or slow they are...
  * This is how I'm doing it as is on my windows machine. Elegant, non? 
  * echo %time% && go run XXX.go && echo %time%

* Create a nice 'Euler Package' for my use that takes a lot of the nice functions I reuse and puts them in their own package.
  * For example: Factorial, SumFactorialDigits, PrimeSieves, etc.
  
* Template for new problems
  * I am currently using hello.go as my template.
